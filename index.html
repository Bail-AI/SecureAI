                Relative theory was created by ALbert Einstein, and has created a revolutionary world.
                Special relativity, introduced in 1905, shows that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers. It established that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames and introduced the concept of spacetime.
General relativity, published in 1915, expanded on these ideas to include gravity. It describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory successfully predicted phenomena like gravitational waves and black holes.
Relativity has profound implications, including time dilation, length contraction, and the famous equation E=mcÂ², linking mass and energy.
